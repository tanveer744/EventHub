Your approach is excellent — clear, structured, and focused on exactly what’s required. The tech stack (Express + PostgreSQL + React) suggested by you is perfect, and my role here is only to shape it into a step-by-step execution plan.

🔑 Step 1. Set up backend (Express + PostgreSQL)

In your repo root, create a server/ folder (keep your current src/ for frontend).

Inside server/:

npm init -y
npm install express pg dotenv cors
npm install -D typescript ts-node-dev @types/node @types/express


Add tsconfig.json.

Create src/index.ts with a simple Express app (GET /health → {ok: true}).

Add DB connection file src/db.ts using pg.Pool.

Run Postgres locally (or Docker). Create DB campus_event_reporting.

🔑 Step 2. Create DB schema

Copy the SQL schema (events, students, registrations, attendance, feedback).

Put it in server/src/sql/schema.sql.

Run it once against your DB:

psql -d campus_event_reporting -f schema.sql


🔑 Step 3. Implement minimal REST endpoints

Make small route files inside server/src/routes/:

events.ts → POST /events, GET /events

students.ts → POST /students

registrations.ts → POST /registrations

attendance.ts → POST /attendance/mark

feedback.ts → POST /feedback

reports.ts →

/reports/event-popularity

/reports/attendance

/reports/avg-feedback

/reports/student-participation

Each route should:

Validate input minimally (req.body fields exist).

Run a prepared SQL query.

Return JSON.

⚠️ Don’t add auth, pagination, filtering, etc. Keep it strictly to assignment requirements.

🔑 Step 4. Test backend first

Use Postman or curl to:

Create a college, students, and events.

Register a student to an event.

Mark attendance.

Submit feedback.

Call reports endpoints and check outputs.

📸 Take screenshots of these outputs (for deliverables).

🔑 Step 5. Wire frontend to backend

Currently you have a static single-page UI. Evolve it into 3 minimal pages (using React Router):

Events Page (list + create form)

Fetch /events?collegeId=1

Form → POST /events

Event Detail Page (registrations, attendance, feedback)

Fetch /registrations?eventId=...

Add checkboxes → POST /attendance/mark

Add rating select → POST /feedback

Reports Page

Fetch /reports/event-popularity?collegeId=1

Fetch /reports/student-participation?collegeId=1

Fetch /reports/attendance?eventId=...

Fetch /reports/avg-feedback?eventId=...

Render them in Tailwind tables

🔑 Step 6. Documentation & deliverables

AI log: save screenshots of this chat + Lovable AI session.

Design doc: describe DB schema, APIs, workflows, assumptions.

README (hand-written): explain how to run backend + frontend, DB setup, how to test reports.

Report outputs: screenshots from Postman/your UI.

Do you want me to now polish this into a final README.md file (with proper headings and formatting for direct submission), or keep it in this raw checklist form?
