# Project Development Process Documentation

## Overview
This document outlines the step-by-step process of developing the EventHub2 project, detailing how various AI tools were leveraged throughout the development lifecycle.

## Phase 1: Ideation and Research
1. **Initial Concept Development**
   - Explained the core idea to Perplexity AI for initial feedback and refinement
   - Used Perplexity's Research Agent to investigate:
     - Industry best practices for event management platforms
     - Modern UI/UX trends for event websites
     - Feature sets of successful event platforms
   - **Output**: `ai_logs/Perplexity Researched Prompt for Lovable.pdf`

2. **Design Phase**
   - Created a detailed design prompt based on research findings
   - Used Loveable to generate the initial UI/UX design
     - **Output**: `ai_logs/lovable.png` (UI mockup)
   - Downloaded the frontend assets from Loveable for implementation
   - **Documentation**: `ai_logs/chatgpt_guide.txt` (Development guide from ChatGPT)

## Phase 2: Backend Development
1. **Requirements Gathering**
   - Consulted ChatGPT to define system architecture
   - Documented API endpoints and data models
   - Outlined authentication and authorization requirements

2. **Implementation with GitHub Copilot**
   - Broke down development into manageable steps
   - For each step:
     - Provided context and requirements to GitHub Copilot
     - Generated and reviewed API endpoint code
     - Implemented database models and business logic
     - Tested functionality iteratively

## Phase 3: Integration
1. **Frontend-Backend Integration**
   - Connected the Loveable-generated frontend with the custom backend
   - Implemented API calls and state management
   - Ensured responsive design across devices

2. **Testing and Refinement**
   - Conducted end-to-end testing
   - Gathered feedback and iterated on the implementation
   - Optimized performance and user experience
